# University of Warwick API client

A client program (`uow-util`) and Haskell library (`uow-apis`) for various University of Warwick APIs. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/mbg/uow-apis/issues/new) if there is an endpoint or a feature you require, but that is not yet supported. Pull requests are also welcome.

## Usage

Pre-built binaries for linux (x86-64) can be downloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/mbg/uow-apis/releases) and [Docker images are also available](https://github.com/mbg/uow-apis/packages/468684).

The `uow-util` tool currently only provides a small number of commands to interact with Tabula and SiteBuilder. For anything else, the `uow-apis` library can be used.

### Configuration

The `uow-util` tool requires user credentials to function. ITS recommend that you use an [external user account](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/its/servicessupport/web/sign-on/externalusers) for this. Note that any external user accounts you create will not have the same permissions you have! You will need to grant any required permissions on Tabula or SiteBuilder as required. 

Once you have suitable user credentials, there are two ways to configure `uow-util` with them. You can create a `uow-util.json` file with the following structure:

```json
{
    "username": "username_goes_here",
    "password": "password_goes_here"
}
```

By default, `uow-util` looks for `uow-util.json` in the current working directory. You can specify a different filename with the `--credentials /path/to/your/config.json` option.

The second option for providing user credentials to `uow-util` is to set environment variables named `UOW_USER` and `UOW_PASSWORD` with the username and password, respectively.

### Tabula commands

#### Download coursework submissions

You can use `uow-util` to download all submissions for a particular coursework. To do this, run `uow-util tabula download MODULE --year YEAR` where `MODULE` is the module code of the relevant module and `YEAR` is the academic year in `yy/yy` format. Your user account will need to have `Permissions.Module.ManageAssignments` on the module and `Permissions.Submission.Read` on the assignment. The program will list all assignments for the module and you can then choose which one to download submissions for.

You can also specify the following options:

- `--unpack` to automatically unpack archives (`.zip` and `.tar.gz`) that are downloaded

- `--only-pdf` to only download `.pdf` files

#### View information about tutees

`uow-util tabula tutees` will show a summary of assignments that have been submitted late or are current late for the personal tutees of a given member of staff. This command requires department-level permissions: 

- `Permissions.Profiles.StudentRelationship.Read`
- `Profiles.Read.Coursework`
- `Profiles.Submission.Read`
- `Profiles.AssignmentFeedback.Read`
- `Profiles.Extension.Read`

You will be prompted for the University ID of the member of staff to view this information for.

#### View information about enrolments 

`uow-util tabula enrolments DEPARTMENT --academic-year YEAR` will show an overview of enrolments for the department identified by `DEPARTMENT` in the academic year given by `YEAR`. For example: `uow-util tabula enrolments cs --academic-year 20/21`. Several options are available which restrict the search:

- `--year YEAR` filters by a specific year group. For example `--year 1` will only return the enrolment status for students in their first year.

- `--course-type TYPE` filters by a specific course type. For example `--course-type PGT` will only return the enrolment status for postgraduate taught students.

The above filters can be combined so that e.g. `uow-util tabula enrolments cs --academic-year 20/21 --year 1 --course-type UG` returns the enrolment status of all first-year undergraduates in Computer Science for 20/21.

### SiteBuilder commands

#### Edit a page

To edit an existing SiteBuilder page (i.e. update it with new HTML), you can run `uow-util sitebuilder edit PAGE FILE` where `PAGE` is the path of the SiteBuilder page to edit and `FILE` is the name of the file to load the new HTML from.

- `--comment 'Fix typo'` can optionally be provided to specify a comment for SiteBuilder's history view about the change

#### Upload a file

To upload a file, such as an image or a PDF, to SiteBuilder, you can use `uow-util sitebuilder upload PAGE FILE` where `PAGE` is the path of the SiteBuilder page under which the file should be uploaded to and `FILE` is the name of the file to upload. 

- `--name FILENAME` can be used to specify a custom name for the file, different from the name of the file that is being uploaded.

#### Syncing a site

To sync a site from a configuration file, you can run `uow-util sitebuilder sync --config FILE`, where `FILE` is the path to the configuration file. See [here](docs/Sitebuilder/Sync.md) for more information about the configuration

### Docker

To acquire the latest version of the Docker image, run `docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/mbg/uow-apis/uow-util:latest` (you may need to be authenticated to the GitHub registry). The image can then be run as usual with `docker run --rm docker.pkg.github.com/mbg/uow-apis/uow-util:latest` and options/commands can be specified as if you were running `uow-util` directly. Using this has the advantage that you do not need to compile the binaries yourself if you are on a platform for which we do not provide pre-built executables.

### Compiling

If you want to compile the library or program yourself, you will first need [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/). The library can then be built with `stack build` and the library+program can be built with `stack build --flag uow-apis:build-exe`. The program can then be invoked with `stack exec uow-util` or installed with `stack install`.

### Library

The library is deliberately not on Hackage/Stackage due to its niche use. You will need to download the sources and compile it locally. You can then point at the library in e.g. the `stack.yaml` for your project with:

```yaml
packages:
- .
- path/to/uow-apis
```

## Tabula API

withTabula Live config $ 
   listAssignments "cs141" (Just "18/19")
```

* [Get a person's assignment information](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/its/servicessupport/web/tabula/api/coursework/assignments/get-member-assignments). You can optionally specify the academic year for which to retrieve assignments.

### Partially implemented endpoints

The following API endpoints are supported internally, but are not currently exposed by `Warwick.Tabula`:

* [Retrieve an attachment's information](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/its/servicessupport/web/tabula/api/fileattachments/retrieve-attachment)

* [Retrieve a job's status](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/its/servicessupport/web/tabula/api/jobs/retrieve-job)

## Peoplesearch API

* *Search profiles* 

```haskell
-- Search profiles for the string "michael"
withAPI Live config $ searchProfiles "michael"
```

* *Lookup users* 

```haskell
-- Retrieve profiles for "1234567"
withAPI Live config $ lookupProfile "1234567"
```

## My Warwick API

The endpoints for posting items to the alert and activity streams are supported. Example for `postAlert`:

```haskell
recipients :: StreamRecipients
recipients = StreamRecipients {
   srUsers = Just ["u1234567"],
   srGroups = Nothing
}

item :: StreamItem
item = StreamItem {
   siType = "test-alert",
   siTitle = "Title",
   siText = "Test body",
   siURL = Just "http://example.com",
   siRecipients = recipients
}

withAPI Live config $ postAlert "example-provider" item
```

To add the item to the activity stream instead of the alert stream, simply replace `postAlert` with `postActivity` in the example above.

## SSO API 

The endpoint for searching users is implemented:

```haskell
withSSO Live "[API KEY]" $ userSearch defaultSearch{ ssoSearchID = Just "1234567" }
```

## Sitebuilder API

- An existing Sitebuilder page can be edited ([API docs](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/its/servicessupport/web/sitebuilder2/faqs/api/pages-and-files/edit-content)). You can either specify the new contents of the file by hand (first example) or load the new contents from a file (second example):

```haskell
update :: PageUpdate
update = PageUpdate {
    puContents = "<html><body>Test</body></html>",
    puRhsContent = Nothing,
    puOptions = defaultPageOpts { poEditComment = Just "change notes" }
}

-- replace the contents of the page at /fac/sci/dcs/test with data from `update`
withAPI Live config $ editPage "/fac/sci/dcs/test" update

-- replace the contents of the page at /fac/sci/dcs/test with the contents of test.html
withAPI Live config $ editPageFromFile "/fac/sci/dcs/test" "change notes" "./test.html"
```

- Pages can be created ([API docs](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/its/servicessupport/web/sitebuilder2/faqs/api/pages-and-files/create-page/)). As above you can either specify the contents by hand or load them from a file
```haskell
opts :: Page
opts = Page{
    pcTitle = "Page Title",
    pcContents = "<html><body>Test</body></html>",
    pcRhsContents = Nothing,
    pcPageName = "testpage",
    pcOptions = defaultPageOpts 
}

-- create a new page at /fac/sci/dcs using data from `create`
withAPI Live config $ createPage "/fac/sci/dcs" opts

-- create a new page with title "Page Title" at /fac/sci/dcs with name "testpage" with the contents of test.html
withAPI Live config $ createPageFromFile "/fac/sci/dcs" "Page Title" "testpage" "./test.html"

withAPI Live cfg $ fileInfo "/fac/sci/dcs/test.pdf"
```

For details about page/file options see [here](docs/Sitebuilder/Types.md)

## Campus API 

The endpoint for searching rooms is implemented as `listRooms` which accepts two parameters: one determining the maximum number of results that should be returned by the API and one which specifies the (partial) search query. For example, the following will retrieve up to ten results where the room names match `"CS2."`:

```haskell
withCampus Live "[API TOKEN]" $ listRooms 10 "CS2."
```

## Postroom API

- A list of postroom hubs can be retrieved:
```haskell
withAPI Live cfg getHubs
```

- The opening times of postroom hubs, and a list of which accommodations use with hubs can be retrieved:
```haskell
withAPI Live cfg getOpeningTimes
```

- The active addresses, if any, of the current user can be retrieved:
```haskell
withAPI Live cfg getMyAddresses
```

- The post items for the current user can be retrieved:
```haskell
